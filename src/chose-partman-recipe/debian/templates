Choices: Manual, 1 disk, 2 disks, 4 disks, 6 disks, 8 disks, 10 disks, 12 disks
Description: Chose partitioning recipe
 Please chose the one of predefined partitioning schemes, which will create:
  * root (10G) and swap (1G) primary partitions
  * LVM volume group named "xenvg" with volume system-stuff (10G)
 .
 If you chose two or more disks, the software RAID will be used as follows:
   - root and swap will be on RAID1 with mirrors on all of the disks
   - LVM will be created with RAID1 on two disks or RAID10 on 4 or moore disks
 .
 NOTE1: We don't recommend you to use RAID5 or RAID6 because they offering
 less productivity for the concurrent access environment.
 .
 NOTE2: RAID10 offers much more productivity than RAID1 but you'll not be
 able to add new disks. (Really, this is not a big problem in a cluster ;)
